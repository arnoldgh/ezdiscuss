This is a discussion forum project with a boardroom like setting. It is written in C# ASP.NET Webforms.

I started using VS2012 but now I'm using VS2017 Community Edition. The backend is SQL Server.

This is my side project that I started working as a hobby. I have done quite a significant amount of work but there are still 
lots of functionalities that I would like to be added. However, since this is an open source now I am open to suggestions and enhancements
that will make this project better.

The following needs some work:
- UI
- Backend
- Security (i.e. credentials encryption)
- Bugs to be fixed

Please contribute to finish this project.

Thank you.

Regards,

Arnold Higuit
